Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
example :- 
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")(right)
  print("yes")

if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")(wrong)
   print("yes")
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
